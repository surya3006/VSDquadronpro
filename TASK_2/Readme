# üß† MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network (Python)

This project trains a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0‚Äì9). It includes training, evaluation, model size/memory estimation, logging, and conversion to TensorFlow Lite format with quantization for size reduction.

## üöÄ Features

- Load and preprocess MNIST data
- Train a neural network using Keras
- Evaluate and visualize predictions
- Log all outputs (model summary, metrics, sizes)
- Save model in `.keras` and `.tflite` formats
- Quantize the model to reduce storage footprint
- Estimate memory usage required for inference

## üìÅ File Structure

mnist_digit_recognition.py # Main Python script
my_model.keras # Saved Keras model
model_quantized.tflite # TFLite quantized model
mnist_training_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log # Log file with training and model info

## How It Works
Loads the MNIST handwritten digit dataset

Normalizes and flattens the image data

Builds a neural network using Dense layers

Trains the model using categorical_crossentropy and Adam optimizer

Evaluates accuracy on the test set

Saves the model as .keras

Converts the model to .tflite (quantized)

Logs all the steps and statistics

## How to run
